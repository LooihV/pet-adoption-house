# Pet Adoption House
Version 2 (V2) of the "Pet Adoption House" project is a continuation of the Software Engineering I course project. Its main objective is to provide an online interface for a pet adoption house. In this web app, users can find information about the pets available for adoption, request them, and track the involved processes.

All this based on a series of actors such as:

1. 	Employees who would be responsible for managing adoption requests;
2. 	Superusers or administrators, who are responsible for managing user permissions, whether employees or adopters;
3. 	Users or adopters, who are the users who want to see the information about the pets and/or request their adoption; and
4. 	Pets, which are our protagonists, the reason why this platform would exist.


In summary, the available pets for adoption are displayed. If a user requests one, an employee receives a notification and begins the adoption process. The platform would be limited to a communication process between the adopter and the adoption house, in a web app that automates this process.
